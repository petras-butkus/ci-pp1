# Project Example Idea 2: Lifehacks Website

## External User’s Goal

The site’s users are interested in solving everyday problems in an intuitive and engaging way.

## Site Owner's Goal

The goal of the site is to be the primary source of solutions to genuinely useful life hacks.

## Potential Features to Include

- Lifehack categories and supporting information
- Supporting text/images/video demonstrating the life hack

# Pass Performance

## LO1: Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility, and responsivity

### 1.1 Design a website that incorporates a main navigation menu and a structured layout
### 1.2 Design a website that meets accessibility guidelines
- Contrast between background and foreground colors
- Non-text elements have planned alt text equivalents to cater for the visually impaired

### 1.3 Design the organization of information on the page following the principles of user experience design
- Headers are used to convey structure
- Information is easy to find due to being presented and categorized in terms of priority

### 1.4 Ensure that foreground information is never distracted by backgrounds
### 1.5 Include graphics that are consistent in style and color
### 1.6 Design the site to allow the user to initiate and control actions such as the playing of audio/video.

## LO2: Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation, and deployment stages

### 2.1 Create a website of at least three pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) at least three separate page areas to match the design and to meet its stated purpose
### 2.2 Write custom HTML code that passes through the official W3C validator with no issues.
### 2.3 Write custom CSS code that passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
### 2.4 Incorporate images that are of sufficient resolution to not appear pixelated or stretched
### 2.5 Code all external links to open in a separate tab when clicked
### 2.6 Use CSS media queries across the application to ensure the layout changes appropriately and maintains the page's structural integrity across device screen sizes.
### 2.7 Use Semantic markup to structure HTML code
### 2.8 Present the finished website with clearly understandable site-specific content, rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
### 2.9 Implement clear navigation to allow users to find resources on the site intuitively.

## LO3: Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform

### 3.1 Deploy a final version of the code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages) and test to ensure it matches the development version
### 3.2 Use Git & GitHub for version control of an interactive web application up to deployment.
### 3.3 Remove commented-out code before pushing final changes to version control and deploying.
### 3.4 Ensure that there are no broken internal links
### 3.5 Insert screenshots of the finished project in the README

## LO4: Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure, and organisation

### 4.1 Write a README.md file for the web application that explains its purpose, the value that it provides to its users, and the deployment procedure.
### 4.2 Insert screenshots of the project features, give a brief description of what each feature does and explain its value to the user.
### 4.3 Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
### 4.4 Clearly separate and identify code written for the website and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials)
### 4.5 Organise HTML and CSS code into well-defined and commented sections
### 4.6 Place CSS code in external files linked to the HTML page in the HEAD element.
### 4.7 Write code that meets at least minimum standards for readability
- Consistent indentation
- Blank lines only appear individually or, at most, in pairs

### 4.8 Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalization to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
### 4.9 Group files in directories by file type
- An assets directory will contain all static files and may be organised into sub-directories such as CSS, images, etc.

## LO5: Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub

### 5.1 Use consistent and effective markdown formatting to produce a README file in English that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.
