LO1 Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity

1.1	Design a website that incorporates a main navigation menu and a structured layout

4.2	Insert screenshots of the project features, give a brief description of what each feature does and explain its value to the user.
4.3	Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.

4.5	Organise HTML and CSS code into well-defined and commented sections
4.6	Place CSS code in external files linked to the HTML page in the HEAD element.
4.7	Write code that meets at least minimum standards for readability (consistent indentation, blank lines only appear individually or, at most, in pairs)
4.8	Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
4.9	Group files in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files and may be organised into sub-directories such as CSS, images, etc.)
LO5 Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub

5.1	Use consistent and effective markdown formatting to produce a README file in English that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.
All Pass criteria must be achieved for a pass to be awarded.
Merit Performance
It is expected that the learning clearly demonstrates characteristics of higher-level performance as described below.

To evidence performance at the Merit level, a learner will, in general, demonstrate characteristics of performance at the Merit level as outlined below. The learner must achieve all Merit criteria for a merit to be awarded.

The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, well-documented website for a real-life audience.

The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences). Its purpose would be immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation. The website’s design follows the principles of UX design and accessibility guidelines, and the site is fully responsive.

Code is well-organised and easy to follow, and the application has been fully tested, following a planned, manual testing procedure, with no obvious errors left in the code.

The development process is evident through commit messages. The project’s documentation provides a clear rationale for the development of this project and covers all stages of the development life cycle.

1.1	Design a website with a flow of information layout and interaction feedback that is clear and unambiguous
1.2	Implement a website whose purpose is immediately evident to a new user. E.g. make the landing page relevant to the site’s primary goal.
1.3	Implement a website that provides an excellent solution to the key project goals, demands and expectations.
2.1	Document any bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any bugs that are left unfixed.
3.1	All HTML attribute and CSS rule names are consistent in format, appropriate and meaningful.
4.1	Present a clear rationale for the development of the project, in the README, - Key project goals, target audience
5.1	Commit often for each feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small and well-defined, with messages that clearly and concisely describe the exact reason for a particular commit.
All Merit criteria must be achieved for merit to be awarded.
Distinction Performance
At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, as described above, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance as described below:
The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application and a comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed.

The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no obvious errors in the code.

Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate, and acceptable to the target user. It clearly matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the course.

Amplification (craftsmanship):

Design

The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:

Information Hierarchy

Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion, with each piece of information being easy to find
all resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively
information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority
User Control

All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional response within the user. This is down to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback
when displaying media files, the site avoids autoplay of audio; instead, let the user initiate and control such actions
Consistency

evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design
Confirmation

user actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times
Accessibility

there is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity
Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience design principles are identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in the README)

Development and Implementation

Code demonstrates the characteristics of ‘clean code’:

Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming, e.g.

file names and class names are descriptive and consistent
for cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only
all HTML attributes and CSS rules are consistent in format, follow standards for the language and are appropriate and meaningful
File structure

whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into sub-directories such as CSS, etc.)
there is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries')
files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
Readability

code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability, and there are no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2)
id/class/attribute names clearly indicate their purpose
CSS code is split into well-defined and commented sections
Semantic markup is used to structure HTML code
HTML and CSS are kept in separate, linked files
CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element
Comments

all custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of code segments
Compliant code

HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
Robust code

no logic errors are found when running code
errors caused by user actions are handled
inputs are validated when necessary.
The full design is implemented, providing a good solution to the users' demands and expectations.

Real-world application

Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
Any custom video content is fit for purpose
Version control systems are used effectively:

all code is managed in git with commit messages that reflect the specific reason for the commit
there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix
there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism
The solution’s purpose is documented:

The purpose of the application is clearly described in the README - key project goals, target audience, screenshots
